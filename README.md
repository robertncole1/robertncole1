### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rob. I have a passion for software development and UX Design. While I am trained as a Full Stack Software Developer, I tend to favor front end development and understanding how a user will interact with an application. I look at things visually and want to understand how things work, how they should look, and how they should interact with the user. I am a problem solver at heart and am mainly looking for ways to take my skills to the next level. Take a look at some of my past projects and let's connect!
